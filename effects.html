        <h2 class="div-content">What are the Effects?</h2>
        <p class="content-p">Global Warming is already affecting the human kind, plant and animals in a number of ways through increased ocean levels, droughts and changed weather patterns.</p>

    <h2>Melting of Glaciers</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This will create a plethora of problems for humankind and the animals living on the earth. Due to increased global warming, the level of the sea will rise which will lead to flooding. It will also endanger several species of animals and will hamper the balance of the ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="desc">
    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Irregular weather patterns have already started showing results. Increased precipitation in the form of rain has already been noticed in polar and sub-polar regions. More global warming will lead to more evaporation which will cause more rains. Animals and plants cannot easily adapt to increased rainfall. Plants may die and animals may migrate to other areas, which can cause the entire ecosystem out of balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="desc">
    <h2>Hurricanes Frequency</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As the temperature of the oceans rises, hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger. With the increase in global warming, the water in the ocean warms up and it heats up the surrounding air, creating hurricanes.</p>
</div>
<div class="desc">
    <h2>Unexpected Heat Waves</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Because of greenhouse gases and other causes, unexpected streaks of severe weather are just the tips of the iceberg in global warming. Heat waves cause dangerously hot weather and in recent years, more deaths have occurred due to heat waves than in the last sixty years.</p>
</div>
<div class="desc">
    <h2>Frequent Wildfires</h2>
    <br>
    <p>While wildfires are a natural occurrence, with the added carbon dioxide in the air, and hotter summers, the evidence speaks for itself. The rate at which they burn is longer than the last, and with the release of carbon dioxide into the air, people as well as wildlife severely suffers. Each time a wildfire burns, the less oxygen there is to combat the dangerous amounts of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<div class="desc">
    <h2>Animal Extinction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Natureâ€™s best is beautifully displayed in every nook of planet earth-the majestic lion, to the humble deer. Imagine whole populations where animals can no longer thrive. With such a vast eruption in the animal kingdom, our own world becomes in danger.</p>
